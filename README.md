# Mubashar 2 - Flutter Starter

This is a minimal, ready-to-build Flutter starter app for an e-commerce store called **Mubashar 2**.
It includes:
- Home screen with categories (Shoes, Clothes, Mobile Accessories)
- Product listing + detail pages
- Cart and simple checkout with options: **Cash on Delivery** and **JazzCash** (no real payment integration)
- Basic state management using Provider
- Placeholder images and a simple placeholder logo

## How to build APK

1. Install Flutter SDK: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install  
2. From project root run:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

## Firebase

Firebase is **not** configured. For storing orders or using push notifications, add firebase_core and follow Firebase setup:
- Add firebase_core to pubspec
- Create a Firebase project and follow FlutterFire CLI setup

## Notes

- This project is a starter template. Payment provider integrations (JazzCash) require merchant credentials and server-side support.
- Feel free to customize colors, assets and add your own logo in `assets/images/`.
